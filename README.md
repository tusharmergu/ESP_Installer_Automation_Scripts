# Selenium Code for Desktop Applications

This repository contains Selenium code for testing desktop applications. The code is written in Java and uses the TestNG testing framework and the Winium driver for automating the installation process of Espressif-IDE 2.12.0 with ESP-IDF 5.1.2 Windows Offline Installer.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `ESP_Agreement.java`: This file contains a test case for the agreement screen of the application's installation process.
- `ESP_Browse_Location.java`: This file contains a test case for browsing and selecting the installation location during the application's installation process.
- `ESP_Install.java`: This file contains a test case for the installation process of the application.
- `ESP_Uninstall.java`: This file contains a test case for the uninstallation process of the application.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you will need to have Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Winium set up on your machine. Once you have these set up, you can run the tests using your preferred Java IDE or from the command line.

Please note that you will need to adjust the paths to the application and the Winium driver according to your local setup.
